# BlendAI: Unleash Your Imagination with AI-Powered 3D Modeling
BlendAI is a Blender add-on that empowers you to create 3D models simply by describing them. No more tedious manual manipulation, just tell BlendAI what you envision, and let the power of AI bring it to life.

What's New in Version 1.3
Major Bug Fixes: Improved code execution and stability.
Log Files: Implemented logging to track previous inputs, allowing for better contextual awareness and debugging.
Getting Started
1. Install the Required Module
BlendAI leverages the google-generativeai library. To install it within Blender's Python environment:

Follow the instructions in this tutorial to install the Python Module Installer for Blender.
Use the Python Module Installer to install the google-generativeai package.

2. Configure Your API Key
Obtain your Gemini API key from AI Studio.
Open the BlendAI Python script and replace the placeholder with your actual API key, ensuring it remains within the quotes.

3. Install BlendAI
Open Blender.
Navigate to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install.
Locate the BlendAI Python script on your computer and click "Install"

4. Enable BlendAI
In the Add-ons tab, find "BlendAI" and enable it by checking the box next to its name.

5. Start Creating!
Access BlendAI by pressing N in the 3D Viewport to open the sidebar. You'll find it under "AI Generator"

Current Limitations
While BlendAI has improved, I'm still working to enhance its capabilities. Current challenges include:

Handling Complex Scripts: Some generated scripts may still need manual tweaking.
Error Handling: While log files improve debugging, some cases may still require manual intervention.
Upcoming Features
I'm excited about the future of BlendAI! Here’s what’s coming soon:

Enhanced Accuracy: Further reducing errors and improving output precision.
Speech-to-Model: Describe your creations using voice input for an even more intuitive design process.
